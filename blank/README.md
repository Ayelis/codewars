# Purpose
	This folder just holds some "blank" files for my code and readme structure

## ðŸ› Why?
	The 'codewar.bat' file in the root folder of this archive copies these files
	automatically and adds information based on user input when tackling a new
	codewars problem. These blank files just make the process a bit easier.
