# codewars
Codewars is a platform I'll use to train, learn, and improve my skills by
solving coding tasks of many difficulty levels and types.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript / Batch scripting

Codewars is where developers achieve mastery through solving challenges.
In this challenge I'll be primarily training on kata written in JavaScript.
This will include algorithms, logic, arrays, data types, and more. Codewars
is an excellent resource for learning JavaScript as it covers the fundamentals
as well as highlighting clever solutions to unique problems. No matter your
experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. âœ…

Meanwhile, to attempt a new challenge, I've built myself a script which,
on the windows command line, terminal, or powershell, create a new folder
for the chosen Codewars project. I simply type "codewar" followed by the
difficulty level, desired folder name, Kata ID, and a short description
of the project to populate the README and solution files. This makes short
work of creating a new project (which I'm well aware how to do).

Wish me luck!
